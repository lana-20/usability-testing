# Usability Testing

## __CAN I USE THIS? - SQA Testing Mnemonic__

Often, usability testing does not receive the attention it deserves. A common argument is that usability issues are merely “training issues” and can be dealt with through the product's training or user manuals. If your product is only for internal staff use, this may be a valid response. However, the market now demands easy-to-use products—whether your users are internal or external. 

David Greenlees shares a tool he has developed to generate test ideas for usability testing. His mnemonic—CAN I USE THIS?—provides a solid starting point for testing any product. C for Comparable Product, A for Accessibility, N for Navigation, and so on.

David shares how he has used this mnemonic on past projects while the training argument took place around him, and how they realized product improvements and greater user acceptance. Learn how you can quickly and effectively use this mnemonic on any project so you can give usability testing the attention it deserves.

## Mobile User Expectations

Per [reports and surveys](https://github.com/lana-20/usability-testing/blob/main/Mobile%20App%20Survey%20Report.pdf), mobile users have far higher expectations of mobile apps when compared to other software like browser applications. The majority of reports and surveys state that nearly __80%__ of users delete an app after using it for the first time! The top four reasons for deletion are always __bad design__ and __usability__, __loading time__ and __crashes__ immediately after installation.

Nearly __60%__ of users will delete an app that requires registration, while more than half of users expect an app to launch in under two seconds. If the app needs more time it gets deleted. Again more than half of users experience crashes the very first time they start an app.
